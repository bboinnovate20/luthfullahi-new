Anyone who wants to know more about the efficacy of Ayatul-Kursiyyi should contact the knowledgeable Islamic Scholars.\n It is prescribed that the aforementioned verses should be written on a daily basis for the pregnant woman to drink in her nineth month of pregnancy. She should be taking the divine mixture daily, right from the beginning of the nineth month until the day of delivery. Insha ALLAH she would deliver peacefully",
